## TSDuck presentations and communication materials

[TSDuck](https://tsduck.io/) is the free and open-source reference framework for MPEG transport streams.

The main source code is in the repository [tsduck/tsduck](https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck).

The repository [tsduck/tsduck-presentations](https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck-presentations)
contains some presentations and communication materials for TSDuck. Most presentations use
Microsoft PowerPoint format. The PDF versions are also stored here.

Binary formats such as PDF and Microsoft Office are not efficiently managed by Git.
Each version is stored as full content, not as differences from previous versions.
Therefore, this repository is not very active and clearly separated from the source
code repository.
